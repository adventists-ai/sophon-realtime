"""Sophon Realtime on a Mac, served over a WebSocket: a network device supplies the microphone and the speaker.

The wire format is the simplest one a small device can speak. Binary frames are raw PCM16 mono audio at --rate, in both directions. A text frame {"type": "interrupt"} means "stop talking now": the server sends it when the user barges in, so the client can drop audio it has buffered, and a client may send it to cut the reply itself (a wake word spoken over the reply, for example). Reply audio is sent in 20 ms frames, no further ahead of real time than LEAD_S: the engine produces speech faster than it is spoken, and a small device has no room to hold the difference. With --events the server also sends the engine's own events (reply_start, first_audio, reply_done, barge_in, ...) as text frames.

The speaker model is WeSpeaker's voxceleb_resnet34_LM.onnx (CC BY 4.0, huggingface.co/Wespeaker/wespeaker-voxceleb-resnet34-LM), needing the onnxruntime package. When it is present, the first voice heard after connecting is taken as the person who woke the device, and speech in other voices (a television, bystanders) is ignored: it starts no reply, does not keep the conversation open, and a reply it cut off is resumed. The conversation ends by itself, after --first seconds of quiet with no reply yet or --followup seconds after a reply has been played: the server sends {"type": "disconnect"} and closes, and the client goes back to waiting for its wake word. The reply audio is also the reference for WebRTC echo cancellation on the incoming audio (--no-aec turns that off for a headset), so the reply is not heard as the user speaking. One conversation at a time: a second client is refused while one is connected.
